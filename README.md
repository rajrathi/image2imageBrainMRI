# Image Translation for MRI using CycleGANs
 This repository contains the project about Image Translation using CycleGANs for converting type T1 MRI into type T2 MRI
 
## Problem Statement
 Misdiagnosis in the medical field is a very serious issue but it’s also uncomfortably common to occur. Imaging procedures in the medical field requires an expert radiologist’s opinion  since interpreting them is not a simple binary process ( Normal or Abnormal). Even so, one radiologist may see something that another does not. This can lead to conflicting reports and make it difficult to effectively recommend treatment options to the patient.

One of the complicated tasks in medical imaging is to diagnose MRI(Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Sometimes to interpret the scan, the radiologist needs different variations of the imaging which can drastically enhance the accuracy of diagnosis by providing practitioners with a more comprehensive understanding.

 
But to have access to different imaging is difficult and expensive. With the help of deep learning, we can use style transfer to generate artificial MRI images of different contrast levels from existing MRI scans. This will help to provide a better diagnosis with the help of an additional image.
